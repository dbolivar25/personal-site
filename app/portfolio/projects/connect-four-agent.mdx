## Connect 4 AI Agent

An artificial intelligence system for playing Connect 4 that combines
traditional game tree search algorithms with machine learning techniques.

### Key Features

- **Hybrid AI Approach**: Combined deterministic search algorithms with
  probabilistic methods

  - Negamax search with alpha-beta pruning for efficient position evaluation
  - Monte Carlo methods for positions beyond training data

- **Phase-based Evaluation Strategy**:

  - Early game: Machine learning based evaluation
  - Mid/late game: Transition to Monte Carlo rollouts as positions diverge from
    training data
  - Endgame: Perfect play through exhaustive search when computationally
    feasible

- **Position Classifier**:

  - 90% accuracy using histogram gradient boosting
  - Trained on the UCI Connect 4 dataset
  - Evaluates board positions based on win probability

- **Optimized Implementation**:
  - Game state representation using NumPy arrays
  - Efficient move generation and win detection algorithms
  - Performance-focused implementation for fast decision making

### Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms**: Negamax with alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search
- **ML Model**: Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Dataset**: UCI Connect 4
- **Repository**:
  [github.com/dbolivar25/connect4-agent](https://github.com/dbolivar25/connect4-agent)

The system effectively integrates classical algorithms with machine learning to
create an agent that adapts to different game situations.
