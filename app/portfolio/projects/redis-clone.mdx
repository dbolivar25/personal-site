## Redis Implementation

A complete Redis server and client implementation built in Rust with a focus on
performance and reliability.

### Key Features

- **Actor-based Event Loop Architecture**: Designed for efficient concurrent
  operations and resource management
- **Core Redis Commands**: Implemented the fundamental Redis command set,
  allowing for drop-in compatibility with existing Redis applications
- **Key Expiration**: Built-in time-based key expiration mechanism
- **Master-Replica Replication**: Support for Redis replication topology to
  ensure data reliability and availability
- **RESP3 Protocol**: Full implementation of the Redis RESP3 wire protocol for
  client-server communication
- **Concurrent Client Connections**: Robust handling of multiple simultaneous
  client connections

### Client Interfaces

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Traditional terminal-based client for direct
  Redis operations
- **Text User Interface (TUI)**: Interactive terminal UI for more intuitive
  Redis management
- **Connection Management System**:
  - Atomic operations support
  - Failover capabilities for high availability
  - Comprehensive logging system

### Technical Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Architecture Pattern**: Actor model
- **Protocol**: RESP3 (Redis Serialization Protocol)
- **Repository**:
  [github.com/dbolivar25/redis](https://github.com/dbolivar25/redis)

The implementation includes full consideration for performance, scalability, and
reliability requirements expected in production-grade distributed systems.
