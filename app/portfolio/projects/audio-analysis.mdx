## Audio Analysis Pipeline

A comprehensive serverless audio processing solution called "Distiller" that
transforms spoken content into structured, analyzed data using AWS cloud
services and advanced NLP techniques.

### Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda and Step Functions for
  scalable, on-demand processing
- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent segmentation of audio content based on
  semantic meaning
- **Recursive Analysis**: Multi-level processing of audio content to extract
  deeper insights
- **Advanced NLP Capabilities**:
  - Sentiment analysis using AWS Comprehend
  - AI-powered summarization using Claude via AWS Bedrock
  - Entity recognition and relationship mapping

### CLI Tool

The project includes a companion command-line interface in Rust that provides:

- **Seamless AWS Service Interactions**: Simplified management of complex AWS
  service integrations
- **File Upload Management**: Efficient handling of audio file uploads to the
  processing pipeline
- **Pipeline Execution Control**: Start, monitor, and manage audio processing
  jobs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into processing status

### Technical Stack

- **Cloud Services**: AWS Lambda, Step Functions, Bedrock, Comprehend
- **Languages**: Rust (CLI), Python (Lambda functions)
- **AI Models**: Claude (for summarization)
- **Repository**:
  [github.com/dbolivar25/distiller](https://github.com/dbolivar25/distiller)

The solution implements a cloud-native architecture with advanced AI/ML
capabilities while providing straightforward interfaces for developers.
