## Quick Wins (1 day)

These tasks can be implemented quickly for immediate benefit:

1. **Add next.config.js** - Improves image optimization and enables key Next.js features
2. **Fix TypeScript configuration** - Makes the development experience better immediately
3. **Switch to gray-matter** - Simple dependency addition that improves reliability
4. **Add proper error handling for data loading** - Prevents crashes and improves robustness
5. **Update package.json** - Ensures consistency and adds needed scripts

## Implementation Steps

### Day 1-2: Foundation
1. Create next.config.js with image optimization and other settings
2. Update tsconfig.json to enable strict mode
3. Add ESLint configuration
4. Update package.json with proper dependencies and scripts
5. Implement basic error handling for critical data loading

### Day 3-5: Performance & Type Safety
1. Implement MDX data caching mechanism
2. Fix image component with proper optimization attributes
3. Replace manual frontmatter parsing with gray-matter
4. Add comprehensive type definitions for data models
5. Fix non-null assertions and improve type safety
6. Memoize expensive component operations

### Day 6-9: Code Quality & Testing
1. Reorganize code structure for better maintainability
2. Add Prettier configuration
3. Set up Jest and React Testing Library
4. Create tests for utility functions
5. Add component tests for critical components
6. Implement GitHub Actions for CI

### Day 10-14: Polish & Refinement
1. Enable strict TypeScript mode and fix remaining issues
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
3. Implement dependency injection patterns
4. Create E2E tests for critical flows
5. Final review and refinements

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The following tasks have dependencies and should be sequenced carefully:

1. **TypeScript Configuration** → **Add Type Definitions** → **Enable Strict Mode**
2. **ESLint Configuration** → **Add Prettier** → **Add GitHub Actions**
3. **MDX Data Caching** → **Component Memoization** → **Component Tests**

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking changes with Next.js updates | High | Medium | Add comprehensive tests, start with a stable version |
| TypeScript strict mode requiring extensive refactoring | Medium | High | Implement gradually, focus on critical files first |
| Performance regressions | High | Low | Add performance tests, benchmark before/after |
| Broken CI/CD pipeline | Medium | Medium | Test workflows locally before pushing |

## Maintenance Plan

After implementation, establish an ongoing maintenance routine:

1. **Weekly**: Run tests and lint checks
2. **Monthly**: Update dependencies with minor versions
3. **Quarterly**: Review and update major dependencies
4. **Bi-annually**: Conduct full codebase review

## Success Metrics

Measure success using the following metrics:

1. **Lighthouse Score**: Aim for 90+ in all categories
2. **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% typed code
3. **Test Coverage**: 80%+ overall coverage
4. **Bundle Size**: Reduce by at least 20%
5. **Load Time**: Under 1.5s for initial page load
