# Personal Site Improvement Plan

## Overview

This improvement plan addresses identified issues in the personal site codebase across several key areas. The plan is prioritized based on both impact and implementation effort, with a focus on resolving critical issues first.

## Priority Areas

### 1. Critical (High Impact, Low-Medium Effort)
- Performance optimizations
- Configuration standardization
- TypeScript consistency and safety

### 2. Important (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
- Code quality improvements
- Error handling
- Developer experience enhancements

### 3. Nice-to-have (Lower Impact, Variable Effort)
- UI/UX refinements
- Accessibility improvements
- Additional features

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Addressing critical configuration and TypeScript issues
2. **Phase 2: Performance** - Implementing performance optimizations
3. **Phase 3: Quality** - Enhancing code quality and developer experience
4. **Phase 4: Polish** - Implementing UI/UX and accessibility improvements

## Specs Structure

- `01-configuration.md` - Configuration improvements (Next.js, TypeScript, etc.)
- `02-performance.md` - Performance optimization recommendations
- `03-typescript.md` - TypeScript safety and consistency improvements
- `04-code-quality.md` - Code quality, linting, and maintainability improvements
- `05-testing.md` - Testing strategy and implementation recommendations

## Expected Benefits

- **Performance**: Faster page loads and better user experience
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and expand the site
- **Type Safety**: Fewer runtime errors and better IDE support
- **Developer Experience**: Faster development cycles and easier onboarding
- **Quality**: More robust and reliable codebase
